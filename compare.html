                <h2>What is Bitcoin and where can I best buy/sell Bitcoins?</h2>
                <p>Bitcoin has become increasingly popular as an electronic means of payment in recent years and has therefore also increased considerably in value. In 2009, this so-called 'cryptocurrency' was introduced. You can manage Bitcoins on your own computer via a digital wallet or you can have this done by a third party, namely a blockchain, or simply put, a wallet service. Anyone with a digital wallet can send and receive the electronic currency.</p>

                    <p><strong>Important Notice:</strong> CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. Between 51% and 82% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs. You should consider whether you understand how CFDs work, and whether you can afford to take the high risk of losing your money.</p>

                <h2>Why pay with bitcoin?</h2>
                <p>There are advantages and disadvantages to using bitcoin. In principle, you no longer need to carry paper money around or keep that sock with money under your mattress. After all, your money is in your digital wallet and you pay electronically. Of course, you can do that with your debit card and bank account, but a bank can see all your payment activity and has the option to block your account. If you have bitcoins, you can pay directly with your virtual wallet at web shops that accept this as a payment method. There is no longer a third party such as a bank or payment processor involved.</p>
                
                <p>The disadvantage is that bitcoins are not legal tender but in principle a means of exchange, like gold for example. This means that you are not entitled to compensation for damage or loss of value. Bitcoins are also susceptible to internet crime and you can not yet pay with them everywhere.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Can Bitcoin Increase Further in Value?</h2>
                <p>Bitcoin price movements often have to do with market conditions. Due to the increased tensions between America and North Korea because of the nuclear tests of the Asian country, the bitcoin has become more valuable in recent times. The value of the electronic currency even went through the threshold of 4,000 dollars, the highest level ever. This also meant an increase in value of almost 300 percent compared to early 2017.</p>
                
                <p>Bitcoin can be used by investors in uncertain political or economic times to trade. An investment that works differently than, for example, paper currencies such as the dollar or euro. And if more investors choose Bitcoin, its value will increase because the currency is more popular and people are therefore willing to pay more for it.</p>
                
                <p>Conversely, the value of the currency can also fall. For example, when a certain price or support level is reached and investors trade their Bitcoins. Then a new impulse is needed to help the currency rise further. If you think that the bitcoin is going to fall, start speculating on a fall.</p>
                
                <p>Negative news about Bitcoin can depress the value of the currency. Recently, prominent figures in the financial world have not been so positive about Bitcoin. For example, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of the American bank JP Morgan Chase, said that he sees no future in the virtual currency. Furthermore, China is said to want to restrict Bitcoin trading. These are risks for Bitcoin trading and therefore also the movement of the electronic currency.</p>
