                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About First Trades</h2>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How much money do I need to start trading?</h3>
                    <p>The amount needed to start trading varies by broker and account type. Some brokers offer accounts with no minimum deposit, while others may require $100 or more. However, it's recommended to start with at least $500-$1000 to have enough capital for proper position sizing and risk management.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the difference between a demo account and a live account?</h3>
                    <p>A demo account allows you to practice trading with virtual money, while a live account uses real money. Demo accounts are perfect for learning the platform and testing strategies without risk. However, they may not fully replicate market conditions and don't involve the emotional aspects of trading with real money.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I choose my first trade?</h3>
                    <p>Start by researching assets you understand well. Consider factors like volatility, trading hours, and your risk tolerance. Many beginners start with major currency pairs in forex or well-known stocks. Always do your research and understand why you're making a particular trade.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is a stop-loss order and why is it important?</h3>
                    <p>A stop-loss order automatically closes your position when the price reaches a predetermined level, limiting your potential losses. It's crucial for risk management and should be set before entering any trade. Never trade without a stop-loss in place.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I know if I'm ready to start live trading?</h3>
                    <p>You're ready for live trading when you can consistently make profitable trades in your demo account, understand your trading strategy, and have a solid risk management plan. You should also be comfortable with the emotional aspects of trading with real money.</p>
