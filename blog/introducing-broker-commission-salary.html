            <h2>Understanding Introducing Broker Compensation</h2>
            <p>Introducing Brokers (IBs) play a vital role in the financial markets by connecting potential clients with brokerage firms. Their compensation structure is unique and can be quite lucrative for those who understand how it works.</p>

            <h3>Commission-Based Income</h3>
            <p>The primary source of income for IBs comes from commissions. Here's how it typically works:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Revenue Sharing:</strong> IBs typically receive a percentage of the spread or commission charged to their referred clients</li>
                <li><strong>Commission Rates:</strong> Usually range from 30% to 70% of the trading fees generated by referred clients</li>
                <li><strong>Volume-Based Tiers:</strong> Many brokers offer increasing commission rates as trading volume grows</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Types of Commission Structures</h3>
            <p>IBs can earn commissions through various structures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cost Per Acquisition (CPA):</strong> Fixed payment for each qualified client referred</li>
                <li><strong>Revenue Share:</strong> Ongoing percentage of trading fees from referred clients</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid Models:</strong> Combination of CPA and revenue sharing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Salary Potential for Introducing Brokers</h2>
            <p>While IBs primarily earn through commissions, some positions may offer base salaries:</p>
            
            <h3>Typical Earnings Breakdown</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Entry-Level:</strong> $30,000 - $50,000 base salary + commissions</li>
                <li><strong>Experienced IBs:</strong> $50,000 - $100,000 base salary + commissions</li>
                <li><strong>Top Performers:</strong> Can earn $200,000+ annually through commissions alone</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Factors Affecting IB Earnings</h2>
            <p>Several factors influence an IB's earning potential:</p>

                <li><strong>Experience Level:</strong> Industry knowledge and client relationships</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Additional Income Opportunities</h2>
            <p>IBs can maximize their earnings through:</p>
            <ul>
