                            <p>Regulated brokers are licensed by financial authorities in their operating regions.

                            <p>Investor protection schemes are financial safety nets that protect client funds in case of broker insolvency. The level of protection varies by region and regulator. For example, FCA-regulated brokers in the UK offer protection up to £85,000 under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). Always check the specific protection limits for your chosen broker.</p>
